# Leaf-Disease-Detection
The latest improvements in computer vision formulated through deep learning have paved the method for how to detect and diagnose diseases in plants by using a camera to capture images as basis for recognizing several types of plant diseases. <br>
**Important Libraries:** pip install numpy, pip install opencv-python, pip install tensorflow, pip install keras, pip install pandas, pip install scipy==1.1.0<br>
**Workflow of Leaf disease detection:** <br>
Dataset Creation [Train, Test, Val] <BR>
CNN Design<br>
Pre-Processing <br>
Training the Model<br>
Load Model to Test<br>
Pre-process of Input Image<br>
Classification<br>


RESULT:<BR>
