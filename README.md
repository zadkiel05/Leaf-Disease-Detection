# Leaf-Disease-Detection-
The latest improvements in computer vision formulated through deep learning have paved the method for how to detect and diagnose diseases in plants by using a camera to capture images as basis for recognizing several types of plant diseases. <br>

Workflow of Leaf disease detection: <br>
Dataset Creation [Train, Test, Val] <BR>
CNN Design<br>
Pre-Processing <br>
Training the Model<br>
Load Model to Test<br>
Pre-process of Input Image<br>
Classification<br>


RESULT:<BR>
